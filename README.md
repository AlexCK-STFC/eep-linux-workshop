# Santa's Linux Workshop
Please run santa's setup script before we start!
## Task 1
<details>Santa left a present in his bedroom - can you navigate there and find it?</details>

## Task 2
<details>One of the elves thinks they might have put the wrong thing inside - can you read the contents of the file to find out what is inside</details>

## Task 3
<details>Can you navigate back to the sleigh and check if his sack contains a present for "Ollie"?</details>

## Task 4
<details>It must have been mislabelled - can you search the whole north pole for the present that contains the word "basketball"?</details>

## Task 5
<details>Can you move the present containing the basketball to the sack in the sleigh - while you are at it, can you re-wrap it in something less soggy, by changing its name to "present-for-Ollie"</details>

## Task 5
<details>Could you write a short note to Ollie to apologise for the damp present, and put it in the sack</details>

## Task 7
<details>Oh no - an evil reindeer has snuck into the pen! Can you delete it?</details>

## Task 8
<details>Santa doesn't have enough reindeer in the pen to pull the sleigh, can you clone them to make more? - make sure one of them has a red nose!

Challenge: Can you clone enough reindeer in a single command?</details>

## Task 9
<details>Now we need to deliver the present - navigate to the rest of the world and find the directory Ollies-house</details>

## Task 10
<details>Can you move the sleigh to the same place as Ollie's House</details>

## Task 11
<details>Can you move the present and apology letter into Ollie's front room</details>
